## Inspiration

I love my hometown Sagana and my community. It's important to note that Sagana is the home to white water rafting in our country. The town's adjacency to the country's largest and longest river, Tana, has been a huge enabler of this beloved water sport. I was struck by how big cities in our country are well marketed, especially in matters of tourism. This inspired me to promote my town, Sagana, which is a hidden gem and the only place one can raft in Kenya. This site serves the purpose of putting my town on the tourism map by making it easy to book and discover the hidden gems in Sagana.
